# ===== PDF / Print runtime configuration =====
# These are read at runtime by the Next.js server process (systemd service `char`).
# Put them into your VPS service environment (systemd override / EnvironmentFile)
# or export them in the shell that starts the server.

# 1) Prefer system-installed Chromium/Chrome (most stable on VPS)
# PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium

# 2) If you do NOT want to install a browser on the OS, try Sparticuz bundled Chromium.
# Note: can increase cold-start time.
# PUPPETEER_USE_SPARTICUZ=1

# 3) Use /dev/shm (faster than disk on HDD). Set to 0 to NOT disable dev-shm usage.
# PUPPETEER_DISABLE_DEV_SHM_USAGE=0

# 4) Timeouts (ms) for HTML -> PDF rendering
# PDF_SET_CONTENT_TIMEOUT_MS=60000
# PDF_RENDER_TIMEOUT_MS=60000

# 5) Puppeteer launch diagnostics
# Increase if Chromium is slow to start on the VPS.
# PUPPETEER_LAUNCH_TIMEOUT_MS=120000

# Print Chromium stdout/stderr into logs (useful when Chromium can't start due to missing libs).
# PUPPETEER_DUMPIO=1

# Fail the whole PDF if any section (features/spells/magic-items) fails.
# Useful for debugging, because otherwise the code may return only the character sheet page.
# PDF_STRICT_SECTIONS=1
